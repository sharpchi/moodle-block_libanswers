# LibAnswers

This block adds the [LibAnswers](http://libanswers.com/) widget (subscription required) to any course page.
This widget is used by the library to provide out of hours online help.

When configuring the instance of the widget, you can specify the hours of availability (usually out-of-hours). During the
out of hours period, the widget will be displayed. During working hours, the widget will be disabled.

You can control which widget is displayed.

You can control which pages the widget will be available on (for example, just the library pages) to prevent teachers from
adding it to their pages. Go to Settings -> limitto, and provide a comma separated list of course URLs. Leave the setting blank
to allow inclusion in any page.

Only those with permissions to add this block (`blocks/libanswers:addinstance`) can edit the instance.

## Note

The developers of this plugin is not in any way associated with or represents LibAnswers.com or SpringShare.com. This plugin was created to help make adding LibAnswer Widgets less codey.
